Instructions

1.	Copy the “Remote PXE” folder to a location on your local machine, it doesn’t matter where.
2.	Open a command prompt in this folder by Shift + Right-Clicking and selecting “Open Command Prompt Here” or navigate to this folder’s location on your local machine using either a Command Prompt or PowerShell terminal.
a.	If using Command Prompt terminal, type “powershell” and enter to turn it into a PowerShell terminal
3.	Execute the script using the simple command “.\remotePXEProgram.ps1”
a.	Using tab-completion you can just type “.\r <TAB>”
4.	When you execute the script for the first 1 or even 2 times, the ConfigurationManager PowerShell module will check for updates and install them if needed.  This will show up as a green rectangle at the top of the window.  If the green box disappears and the script is hanging you can simply <Ctrl-C> to terminate and execute the script again.
5.	The script checks for 2 things upon startup, PowerShell version and if the Configuration Manager Admin Console is installed (or rather if the ConfigurationManager.psm1 PowerShell module exists)
a.	If something is wrong at this point you will get errors accordingly.
6.	The script will guide you through basically the rest of the process of the deployment.
